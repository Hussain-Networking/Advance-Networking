EIGRP Unequal-Cost Load Balancing Explained 

1. Default Behavior:
EIGRP normally uses only equal-cost paths for load balancing. By default, it uses up to 4 equal-cost paths.

2. What We Did:
We changed the bandwidth on R2 interfaces to make one path worse. Now the two paths to 192.168.1.0/24 are not equal anymore.

3. Why Only One Path Appeared:
EIGRP only uses equal-cost paths unless we tell it otherwise. With default variance = 1, only the best path is used.

4. Feasible Successors:
A path can only be used if it is a feasible successor:
- Its reported distance (RD) < best feasible distance (FD)
- This ensures loop-free paths

5. Variance:
Variance allows EIGRP to use worse paths safely.
- Formula: FD <= variance × best FD
- If this is true and the path is a feasible successor, it becomes a usable path.

6. Example:
- Best FD = 2621440
- Second path FD = 2785280, RD = 2129920
- 2129920 < 2621440 ✅ (feasible successor)
- Variance 2 → 2 × 2621440 = 5242880
- 2785280 <= 5242880 ✅ (path used)

7. Result:
- Now R3 uses both paths
- Traffic is shared proportionally based on metrics, not 50/50
- Better path carries slightly more traffic

8. Key Points:
- Only feasible successors are used
- Variance does not create loops
- Unequal-cost load balancing uses metrics to decide traffic share

This allows EIGRP to use multiple paths safely and efficiently, even if they are not equal.
