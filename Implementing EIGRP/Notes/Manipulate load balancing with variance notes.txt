EIGRP Unequal Cost Load Balancing – Caveats Explained

There are two important caveats when using EIGRP variance.

1. Only Feasible Successors Are Used
EIGRP does not load-balance over every available path.
A route must be a feasible successor to be considered.

This means the neighbor’s reported distance must be lower than
the current feasible distance of the best route.

If a path does not meet this feasibility condition, EIGRP will
not use it, even if the variance value allows it.
This rule exists to prevent routing loops.

2. Unequal Cost Load Balancing Is Not Equal
When EIGRP performs unequal cost load balancing, traffic is not
shared evenly.

Traffic is distributed proportionally based on the metric of
each path.
The path with the lowest metric carries more traffic, while
higher-metric paths carry less.

Example:
Best path metric = 10
Second path metric = 20

The best path will carry about twice as much traffic as the
second path.

Summary:
Variance allows EIGRP to use multiple paths, but only safe
(loop-free) paths are allowed, and traffic always favors the
best path.
