EIGRP STUB 

An EIGRP stub router is a leaf router. It sits at the edge of the network and does not provide paths to other routers. Nothing important exists behind it except its own local networks.

When a route fails in EIGRP, routers send query messages asking neighbors if they know another path. If queries spread everywhere, convergence becomes slow.

Without a stub configuration, a hub router will still send queries to a leaf router, even though that leaf router can never help. This wastes time and CPU.

When you configure eigrp stub on a router, that router tells its neighbor:

“I am a dead end. Do not send me queries for missing routes.”

After this:

- The hub router stops sending EIGRP queries to the stub router

- Queries are contained closer to the failure

- Convergence becomes faster

A stub router only advertises:

- Its directly connected networks

- Summary routes (if configured)

In this lab:

- D1 is the stub router (edge device)

- R1 is the hub router

- When a route fails, queries stop at R1 and never reach D1

ONE-LINE SUMMARY

EIGRP stub prevents unnecessary EIGRP queries from being sent to edge routers, making the network converge faster.
