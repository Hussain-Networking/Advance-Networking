EIGRP HELLO PACKETS AND HOLD TIME

Hello Packets:
Hello packets are small EIGRP messages used to discover and maintain neighbors.
They do NOT carry routing information.

Purpose of hello packets:
- Discover new EIGRP neighbors
- Keep existing neighbor relationships alive
- Verify that neighbors are reachable

If hello packets stop arriving, the router assumes the neighbor may be down.

Hello Interval:
The hello interval is how often hello packets are sent.
The default value depends on interface speed.

Hold Time:
Hold time is the maximum time a router will wait to receive a hello packet
from a neighbor before declaring that neighbor dead.

If no hello is received before the hold time expires:
- The neighbor is removed
- Routes learned from that neighbor are deleted
- EIGRP recalculates routes (DUAL process runs)

Relationship Between Hello and Hold Time:
- Hello interval controls how often hellos are sent
- Hold time controls how long a router waits
- Hold time is usually 3 times the hello interval
- Hold times do NOT need to match between neighbors

Default Values:
For links greater than T1 (1.544 Mbps):
- Hello interval: 5 seconds
- Hold time: 15 seconds

For links T1 or slower:
- Hello interval: 60 seconds
- Hold time: 180 seconds

Summary:
Hello packets say "I am still here".
Hold time is the deadline before EIGRP decides a neighbor is down.
